# Reaper Bits and bobs

ReaPack compatible repository for my random REAPER scripts and jsfx

Currently content:

**Next Variation**
- Sound design workflow improvement plugin for automatically moving item audio content start position to next variation.

**Region Naming Tool**
- Naming tool, which makes it easy to name multiple regions at once and allows using custom word lists

**Split and Keep Fade Curves**
- Does exactly what name implies. I got tired of split not working how I wanted it to work
