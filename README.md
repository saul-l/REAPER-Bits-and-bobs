# Reaper Bits and bobs

ReaPack compatible repository for my random REAPER scripts and jsfx

Currently content:

**Next Variation**

Sound design workflow improvement plugin for automatically moving item audio content start position to next variation.


**Region Naming Tool**

Naming tool, which makes it easy to name multiple regions at once and allows using custom word lists

Requires Lokasenna's GUI library v2 for Lua.  
- Use ReaPack to download it from this repo: https://github.com/ReaTeam/ReaScripts/raw/master/index.xml or downloaded directly from here: https://github.com/jalovatt/Lokasenna_GUI  
- After installation you might need to run action Script: Set Lokasenna_GUI v2 library path.lua
  
**Split and Keep Fade Curves**

Does exactly what name implies. I got tired of split not working how I wanted it to work
